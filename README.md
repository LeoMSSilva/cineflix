# :house: About

This project was developed in **typescript** language, using **reactJs** framework.

I used **vite** during development to speed up the creation of static pages for real-time viewing.

I used **javascript** and **json** languages ​​as secondary languages, just for the configuration files.

I used the **commitlint**, **@commitlint/config-conventional**, **commitizen** and **cz-conventional-changelog** libraries to keep the patterns in the commits, the **prettier**, **@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports** and **eslint** (_config_: **prettier**, **react**, **react-hooks**, **tailwindcss**; _plugins_: **prettier**, **@typescript-eslint**, **react**, **react-hooks**, **tailwindcss**; _parser_: **@typescript-eslint**) libraries to maintain formatting standards, also helping to remove errors in the code, and the **husky**, **lint-staged** libraries to automate tasks before committing new code to ensure that the code is formatted and without errors.

I used **phosphor** for icons styled.

I used **tailwindcss**, **postcss** and **autoprefixer** to style css with component accessibility.

This project is about a website that lists movies.

You can access the project through the link published at **[firebase](https://cineflix-aadd8.web.app)**.
